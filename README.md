# 2D Image Manipulation Project 📃

This project performs various image manipulation tasks using Java’s `BufferedImage` class, allowing you to manipulate images by applying effects, generating random images, and saving the output. It's useful for learning basic image manipulation techniques, working with pixel data, and generating custom images.

## ⚙️ Image Manipulation
   - **Trim Borders**: Removes a specified number of pixels from each side of an image.
   - **Negative Color**: Inverts the colors of each pixel to create a "negative" effect.
   - **Stretch Horizontally**: Expands the width by duplicating pixels horizontally.
   - **Shrink Vertically**: Reduces the height by skipping every other row of pixels.
   - **Invert Image**: Flips the image both vertically and horizontally.
   - **Color Filter**: Adds a color filter by adjusting the red, green, and blue values of each pixel.
